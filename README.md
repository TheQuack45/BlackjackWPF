# **BlackjackWPF**

This is a Blackjack game written in C# and the Microsoft .NET framework. It was written for a school project over a period of roughly 1 month.

## **Technologies/design patterns used**

This project was written in C# 6.0 with the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6. It uses Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for the GUI production,
and implements the Model View ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern. (though I don't guarantee that I used MVVM properly.)

## **Attributions**

Thanks to Microsoft for the beauty that is C#, .NET, and WPF.
